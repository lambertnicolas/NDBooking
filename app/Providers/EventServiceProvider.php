// TODO : Event Discovery In Production : In production, it is not efficient for the framework to scan all of your listeners on every request. Therefore, during your deployment process, you should run the event:cache Artisan command to cache a manifest of all of your application's events and listeners. This manifest will be used by the framework to speed up the event registration process. The event:clear command may be used to destroy the cache.
